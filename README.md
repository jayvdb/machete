# machete

A simple python boilerplate - and multi template! - to start your python work.

It is currently in development, but is pretty usable if installed directly from GitHub, if grabbed from master branch.

##To install it:

```
sudo pip install -e git+https://github.com/lovato/machete.git#egg=Package
```

When it becomes available at Pypi, it will be possible to install it directly from there, in a simpler way.

##Usage:

First, create your target directory, and cd to it.

Note: This directory must be empty. If you need to re-run machete, please empty the current folder first.

```
usage: machete [-h] -t TEMPLATE [--chicken]

machete

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TEMPLATE, --template TEMPLATE
                        Select one of the available templates (TODO list them
                        here).
  --chicken             Chicken mode (optional). Does NOT CHANGE anything.

```
